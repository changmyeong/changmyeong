# Changmyeong Baek

I have extensive experience in both web frontend and backend layers, with a strong background in AWS Cloud infrastructure and microservices architecture.

As a co-founder and CTO of a blockchain company, I led the technology strategy and successfully launched a product that ranked in the global Top 10 of blockchain dapps, eventually leading to the company's acquisition by Netmarble Company.

I prefer working based on clear evidence and reasoning, but I also value fast execution and flexible decision-making. I am skilled at clearly defining problems, designing structured solutions, and enjoy growing alongside my team while delivering meaningful results.
